This is what's in my head for the story I think (or I would like) to tell with this submission:
**The importance of trust + convenience, and what is possible when you strike the right balance**
1. Trust:
Requires many things, principally of which are clarity and transparency, and a clear separation of concerns (no conflicts of interest)
Show:
* "kerits" -- the core KERI foundation, claims and attestations of information, and data privacy
* "smart tokens" : STEX exchange and KeriTokens for digital assets.separates the concerns of token issuance from KYC/KYB
responsibilities
2. Convenience:
Mostly people will do what's easiest. Napster wasn't about stealing music - people were happy to pay when iTunes came about.
C. A. R. Hoare famously stated there are two ways to build a software design:
"make it so simple that there are no obvious deficiencies, or make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies"
Our submission tries to demonstrate in very simple terms the strong, secure foundations on which we can build robust and


Show:
* "MCP agents" (software artefact):
easily just ask "Is this person on a sanctions list? Is this person allowed to transact on behalf of a company? What is the LEl for this company, and does LSEG acknowledge that? Show me the proof that John Doe is not a politically exposed person"
* "merits" (API software artefact): a secure peer-to-peer channel to sync latest KERI data (e.g. "Do I have Jane Doe's latest identity, or has her private key been compromised?")
* Token Issuance flow (user flow): Issuers not having to re-do or re-onboard recipients
* End users (user flow): Asset holders can simply buy/sell/ transfer digital assets seemlessly and safely, while still protecting their information
* Regulators / Auditors (user flow): The know the due diligence is handled, current, and easily traceable
