# About

This project tells a story:

The importance of trust + convenience, and what is possible when you strike the right balance

1. Trust:
      Requires many things, principally of which are clarity and transparency, and a clear separation of concerns (no conflicts of interest)

      Show:
        "kerits" -- the core KERI foundation, claims and attestations of information, and data privacy
        "smart tokens" : STEX exchange and KeriTokens for digital assets.
           separates the concerns of token issuance from KYC/KYB responsibilities
      

2. Convenience:
     Mostly people will do what's easiest. Napster wasn't about stealing music - people were happy to pay when iTunes came about.

    C. A. R. Hoare famously stated there are two ways to build a software design: 

    "make it so simple that there are no obvious deficiencies, or make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies"

    Our submission tries to demonstrate in very simple terms the strong, secure foundations on which we can build robust and convenient digital assets

     Show:
       "MCP agents" (software artefact):
          easily just ask "Is this person on a sanctions list? Is this person allowed to transact on behalf of a company? What is the LEI for this company, and does LSEG acknowledge that? Show me the proof that John Doe is not a politically exposed person"

        "merits" (API software artefact): a secure peer-to-peer channel to sync latest KERI data (e.g. "Do I have Jane Doe's latest identity, or has her private key been compromised?")

        Token Issuance flow (user flow): Issuers not having to re-do or re-onboard recipients

        End users (user flow) : Asset holders can simply buy/sell/transfer digital assets seemlessly and safely, while still protecting their information

        Regulators / Auditors (user flow): The know the due diligence is handled, current, and easily traceable

# Exec Summary

This submission (for me) has all been about **trust** and **convenience**, and what's possible when you have both.

Financial systems are rooted in trust: *"I promise to pay the bearer..."* is printed on currency.

To have trust isn't easy. We need several (often competing) things: security, privacy, transparency, reliability...

We also can't overlook **convenience**. People will do what is easy, and cut corners if it's not.

For those old enough to remember, we learned that napster wasn't about stealing music -- what people really wanted was convenience. They were happy (and preferred to) pay the artists for their music on iTunes after it came out.


This submission demonstrates not just vLEIs, but how we can marry trust and convenience to unlock value.
