üîê Controller-side Flow
1. Create AID and Inception Event

You generate keys and build the inception (icp) event:

{
  "v": "KERI10JSON0000fb_",
  "t": "icp",
  "i": "EDEzWz9wV...lbx",
  "s": "0",
  "kt": "1",
  "k": ["DA8mL9D2k...mQe"],
  "n": "EGsJ7txvY...v8o",
  "bt": "0",
  "b": [],
  "c": [],
  "a": []
}


You sign this event with your private key(s).
The sig attached is already a cryptographic proof that the same keypair created this AID.

However, when publishing, the receiver can‚Äôt yet be sure that you are the signer ‚Äî since anyone could forward this signed event.

2. Receive a Challenge From OOBI Server

Before accepting the posted KEL, the OOBI server challenges you to prove live key control.
It sends something like:

{
  "t": "challenge",
  "a": "EDEzWz9wV...lbx",
  "n": "randomNonce123"
}

3. Sign and Return the Challenge

You sign the nonce using your current signing key(s) from the just-incepted event:

{
  "t": "response",
  "a": "EDEzWz9wV...lbx",
  "n": "randomNonce123",
  "sigs": ["0BDA8mL9D2k...signatureBytes"]
}


This step proves live possession of the private keys tied to the AID.

4. Server Verifies and Accepts the KEL

The OOBI server:

Looks up the current KEL state (from your icp event).

Checks signatures against your current key set k and threshold kt.

If valid ‚Üí it accepts and stores your KEL as authoritatively controlled by you.

üí° Why This Is Necessary

Without that challenge step, a malicious actor could post a copied KEL belonging to someone else, fooling peers into believing the legitimate controller is reachable at that endpoint.

üß© Summary
Step	Actor	Action	Proof
1	Controller	Create AID + icp	Signs event
2	OOBI Server	Send random challenge	Nonce
3	Controller	Sign challenge with AID‚Äôs keys	Demonstrates live key control
4	Server	Verify sigs meet threshold	Accept and store KEL
‚úÖ Minimal Example Round-Trip
Server ‚Üí Controller:  CHALLENGE  nonce=R4fWz...
Controller ‚Üí Server:  RESPONSE  sign(nonce, keys from latest KEL)
Server ‚Üí OK: Valid signatures (‚â• kt)


Result:

OOBI accepts and associates AID EDEzWz9wV...lbx with the published KEL and endpoint ‚Äî proof of key control established.
