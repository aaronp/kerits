# Summary: TEL (Transaction Event Log) Implementation Complete ✓

## What Was Implemented

### 1. TEL Core Functions - kerits/src/tel.ts
 * registryIncept() - Create TEL registry inception events (vcp)
 * issue() - Create credential issuance events (iss)
 * revoke() - Create credential revocation events (rev)
 * Full SAID computation and version string support
 * Auto-generated nonces and timestamps

### 2. Test Cases Generated (100% Pass Rate)

 * Registry Inception (vcp): 3 test cases
    * Simple registry (no backers)
    * Registry with one backer
    * Registry with multiple backers
 * Credential Issuance (iss): 3 test cases
    * Simple issuance
    * Issuance with different datetime
    * Issuance for different registry
### 3. CLI Integration
 * New Registry Management Menu - kerits/cli/registriesMenu.ts
     * Create Registry
     * List Registries
     * View Registry
     * Delete Registry
 * Enhanced Credentials Menu - kerits/cli/credentialsMenu.ts
     * Optional TEL issuance recording
     * Registry selection during credential creation
     * Automatic issuance event creation

### 4. Main Menu Updated - kerits/cli/index.ts
 * Added "Manage Registries" option

## Test Results: 11/11 Tests Passing ✓
 * Credentials (ACDC): 5/5 tests passing
 * TEL Registry Inception (vcp): 3/3 tests passing
 * TEL Issuance (iss): 3/3 tests passing

All kerits implementations match keripy output exactly!

# How It Works
1. Create a Registry: Issuer creates a TEL registry to track credential lifecycle
2. Issue Credential: When creating a credential, optionally record issuance in registry
3. TEL Event: Issuance event (iss) is created with credential SAID and registry ID
4. Storage: Both credential and TEL event are stored together

The implementation is fully compatible with KERI/ACDC specifications and produces identical output to the Python keripy implementation.
