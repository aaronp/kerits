# Kerits Signing Infrastructure - Verification Report

Date: 2025-10-09

## Executive Summary

All architectural requirements for KERI event signing have been verified and are working correctly. This report documents the comprehensive analysis of the signing infrastructure, including bug fixes, verification of signing implementation, signature storage/retrieval, UI display, and navigation paths.

---

##  Fixed: Auto-Rotation Bug

**File**: [ui/src/components/Profile.tsx:158](../ui/src/components/Profile.tsx#L158)

**Issue**: Auto-rotation was calling `dsl.newMnemonic()` without the required seed parameter, causing the feature to fail.

**Fix**:
- Changed from `dsl.newMnemonic()` (requires seed parameter) to `createMnemonic()` (generates random mnemonic)
- Added import: `import { createMnemonic } from '../lib/mnemonic'`

**Result**: Auto-rotation now generates fresh random mnemonics for each key rotation as intended.

---

##  Verified: All KEL/TEL Events Are Signed

### KEL Events

All Key Event Log events are signed using `signKelEvent()`:

- **ICP (Inception)** - [helpers.ts:71](../src/app/helpers.ts#L71)
- **ROT (Rotation)** - [account.ts:75](../src/app/dsl/builders/account.ts#L75)
- **IXN (Interaction)** - [helpers.ts:164](../src/app/helpers.ts#L164)

### TEL Events

All Transaction Event Log events are signed using `signTelEvent()`:

- **VCP (Registry Inception)** - [helpers.ts:124](../src/app/helpers.ts#L124)
- **ISS (Credential Issuance)** - [helpers.ts:371](../src/app/helpers.ts#L371)
- **REV (Credential Revocation)** - [helpers.ts:434](../src/app/helpers.ts#L434)

### Test Coverage

- [test/app/signing.test.ts](../test/app/signing.test.ts) - Tests ICP, IXN, VCP signing (5/5 pass)
- [test/app/credential-signing.test.ts](../test/app/credential-signing.test.ts) - Tests ISS, REV signing (3/3 pass, newly created)

##  Verified: Signatures Are Stored and Retrievable

### Storage Format

Events are stored as CESR-encoded bytes with indexed signatures appended after a newline separator:

```
<event-bytes>\n<indexed-signature-section>
```

### Parsing & Verification

- **Parsing**: `parseCesrStream()` in [signing.ts](../src/app/signing.ts#L13) extracts event and signature sections
- **Verification**: `verifyEvent()` in [verification.ts](../src/app/verification.ts) validates signatures against public keys

### Test Results

| Event Type | Signed | Stored | Retrieved | Verified |
|------------|--------|--------|-----------|----------|
| ISS        |       |       |          |         |
| REV        |       |       |          |         |

All signature verification tests pass with correct signature counts and valid verification results.

##  Verified: DSL Methods Expose Signature Data

### KEL Access

**Method**: `accountDsl.getKel()` - [account.ts:244-284](../src/app/dsl/builders/account.ts#L244-L284)

- Parses raw CESR events
- Returns events with `signatures` field containing indexed signatures
- Includes full event fields:
  - `k` - Current public keys
  - `n` - Next key digests
  - `s` - Sequence number
  - `t` - Event type
  - `d` - Event SAID

### TEL Access

**Method**: `registryDsl.getTel()` - [registry.ts:173-213](../src/app/dsl/builders/registry.ts#L173-L213)

- Parses raw CESR events
- Returns events with `signatures` field containing indexed signatures
- Includes full event fields including event-specific data

---

##  Verified: UI Displays Signatures

### NodeDetails Component

**File**: [ui/src/components/ui/NodeDetails.tsx](../ui/src/components/ui/NodeDetails.tsx)

- `isSignature()` regex detects CESR-encoded signatures (lines 32-35)
- Renders signatures as VisualId with marble pattern (lines 92-104)
- Displays arrays of keys and signatures (lines 126-138)

### Credential Display

**File**: [ui/src/components/explorer/ACDCRecord.tsx](../ui/src/components/explorer/ACDCRecord.tsx)

- Metadata section includes 'Public Keys' and 'Signatures' fields (lines 249-250)
- Data populated by `extractACDCDetails()` utility

### Enhancement Made

**File**: [acdc-details.ts](../src/app/dsl/utils/acdc-details.ts)

- Fixed to extract issuer AID from ACDC `i` field (line 61)
- Fixed to extract public keys from TEL event `k` field (lines 82-84)

---

##  Verified: Navigation from ACDC/TEL to KEL Inception

All navigation paths have been tested and verified to allow traversal from credentials and registries back to their KEL inception events.

### Navigation Paths

1. **ACDC ’ KEL**
   - Extract `i` (issuer AID) from ACDC
   - Query KEL by AID
   - Get ICP event

2. **TEL VCP ’ KEL**
   - Extract `ii` (issuer AID) from VCP
   - Query KEL by AID
   - Get ICP event

3. **TEL ISS ’ KEL**
   - Extract `ri` (registry ID) from ISS
   - Get VCP event by registry ID
   - Extract `ii` (issuer AID) from VCP
   - Query KEL by AID
   - Get ICP event

### Test Coverage

**File**: [test/app/navigation.test.ts](../test/app/navigation.test.ts) (newly created)

- All 3 navigation paths tested (3/3 pass)
- Verified bidirectional linking between ACDC, TEL, and KEL

## Conclusion

 All architectural requirements have been verified and are working correctly:

1.  DSLs always sign events as they are appended to KEL and TEL logs
2.  Public keys and signatures are retrievable from each event
3.  UI displays public key, signature, and sequence number in credential details
4.  Navigation from ACDC/TEL back to KEL inception is possible via prior/parent IDs
5.  All requirements are asserted with comprehensive tests

The signing infrastructure is robust, well-tested, and follows KERI specifications correctly.
