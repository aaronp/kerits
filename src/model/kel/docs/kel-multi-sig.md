# **üß± KERI Multi-Sig Specification Summary**

### **Purpose**

Enable a single Autonomous Identifier (AID) to be **controlled by multiple participants or devices**, enforcing **threshold signing** (e.g. ‚Äú2 of 3 keys must sign‚Äù for any KEL event).

---

## **1\. Establishment Events and Thresholds**

Every KEL event that defines or rotates key material (icp, rot) has:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `k` | Array of current signing public keys |
| `kt` | Signing threshold ‚Äî minimum number of valid signatures required |
| `n` | Next key commitment (SAID of next key set) |
| `nt` | Next threshold (for next rotation) |

---

## **2\. Valid Signatures for a Multi-Sig Event**

When verifying an establishment event:

1. Compute the event‚Äôs SAID.

2. Verify that there are ‚â• `kt` valid signatures from the set `k`.

3. Each signature must correspond to one of the listed keys (by index).

4. The event is only accepted if the threshold is met.

These signatures may originate from multiple devices or co-controllers.

---

## **3\. Types of Multi-Sig**

| Type | Description | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Multi-key** | Multiple keys listed directly in one AID‚Äôs KEL | ‚Äú2-of-3 device keys‚Äù |
| **Multi-AID (Group AID)** | Multiple existing AIDs jointly control a *group* AID via a **delegated inception** | ‚ÄúOrg AID controlled by Alice \+ Bob‚Äù |

Both are valid in KERI ‚Äî the first is simpler for local multi-device scenarios; the second for organizational control.

---

## **4\. How Events Get Signed**

* **Inception (`icp`)**

  * Lists all controller public keys (`k`) and the signing threshold (`kt`).

  * Each controller signs the serialized event.

  * Event is accepted only when the collected signatures ‚â• `kt`.

* **Rotation (`rot`)**

  * Reveals the previously committed `n` as the new `k`.

  * New next commitment (`n'`) and threshold (`nt'`) are included.

  * Must be signed by ‚â• `kt` keys from the *previous* key set.

* **Interaction (`ixn`)**

  * Used for anchoring or data linking.

  * Must also be signed by ‚â• `kt` current keys.

  ## **5\. Witnesses in Multi-Sig Context**

Witnesses (`w`, `wt`) work exactly as usual ‚Äî they **attest**, not authorize.  
 They don‚Äôt replace threshold signatures; they only add network receipts.

# **üß™ Test Scenarios for Multi-Sig KELs**

---

### **Scenario 1 ‚Äì Single-Device Inception (Baseline)**

**Goal:** Create a 1-of-1 AID and validate simple rotation.

**Steps:**

1. Generate key pair K‚ÇÅ.

1. Build `icp` with:

    `{ "k": [K‚ÇÅ.pub], "kt": "1", "n": SAID(nextKeys) }`  
2.   
3. Sign with K‚ÇÅ.

4. Validate inception.

5. Build a `rot` signed again by K‚ÇÅ ‚Üí should pass.

‚úÖ *Baseline KEL flow works with one controller.*

---

### **Scenario 2 ‚Äì Multi-Device Inception (2-of-2)**

**Goal:** A single AID controlled jointly by two devices.

**Steps:**

1. Devices A and B each generate key pairs K‚Çê and K·µ¶.

2. Build an `icp`:

    `{`  
3.   `"k": [K‚Çê.pub, K·µ¶.pub],`  
4.   `"kt": "2",`  
5.   `"n": SAID(nextKeys)`  
6. `}`  
2.   
3. Both A and B sign the same inception event.

4. Combine both signatures (two CESR attachments).

5. Event is accepted (2 signatures ‚â• `kt=2`).

‚úÖ *This AID now requires both devices to sign any rotation.*

---

### **Scenario 3 ‚Äì Add Another Device (Creating a Linked AID)**

**Goal:** Add a new device that has its own AID, anchored by the original.

**Steps:**

1. Existing AID\_A (2-of-2) exists on devices A and B.

2. Device C creates a new AID\_C (`icp_c`).

3. AID\_A performs an `ixn` anchoring AID\_C‚Äôs inception SAID ‚Äî effectively ‚Äúdelegating‚Äù authority or acknowledging it.

4. Observers can replay:

   * AID\_C‚Äôs KEL ‚Üí see its `icp_c`

   * AID\_A‚Äôs KEL ‚Üí see the anchoring `ixn`  
      and accept that AID\_C is linked to AID\_A.

‚úÖ *Demonstrates linking sub-identities or new devices via anchoring.*

---

### **Scenario 4 ‚Äì Rotation with 2-of-2 Threshold**

**Goal:** Rotate the AID, requiring both controllers to sign.

**Steps:**

7. AID\_A‚Äôs current state:

    `{ "k": [K‚Çê, K·µ¶], "kt": "2", "n": SAID(nextKeys) }`  
1.   
2. Both controllers generate next keys (K‚Çê‚Ä≤, K·µ¶‚Ä≤).

3. Build `rot` event revealing `n` ‚Üí `k = [K‚Çê‚Ä≤, K·µ¶‚Ä≤]`.

4. Both A and B sign the `rot`.

5. Validation passes only if both signatures present.

‚úÖ *Confirms enforced multi-signature rotation.*

---

### **Scenario 5 ‚Äì Failure Case: Insufficient Signatures**

**Goal:** Reject invalid rotation with only one signature.

**Steps:**

1. Same AID\_A (2-of-2).

2. Device A alone signs the rotation event.

3. Validator checks signatures ‚Üí finds only one valid signature.

4. Reject event (`kt` not satisfied).

‚úÖ *Confirms enforcement of threshold.*

---

### **Scenario 6 ‚Äì Rotation Increasing Threshold (2-of-3)**

**Goal:** Extend control to a third device.

**Steps:**

1. AID\_A current state: `kt=2`, `k=[K‚Çê,K·µ¶]`.

2. New key Kùöå added in next commitment (`n‚Ä≤`).

3. Next rotation reveals new `k=[K‚Çê‚Ä≤,K·µ¶‚Ä≤,Kùöå‚Ä≤]`, `kt‚Ä≤="2"`.

4. Requires ‚â• 2 signatures from current set (K‚Çê,K·µ¶) to authorize.

5. After accepted, future events may use any 2 of 3\.

‚úÖ *Simulates adding a new controller while keeping threshold logic intact.*
