ðŸ§© Relationship to Other Structures

 * KEL (Key Event Log):	Full ordered list of all events	All events (icp, rot, ixn, etc.)
 * KEL Event:	Single event in the KEL	Keys, witnesses, commitments
 * KSN (Key State Notice):	Latest derived state	Flattened digest of latest key state, plus signatures
 * KERL (Key Event Receipt Log):	KEL + receipts	Log + witness/validator receipts
 * OOBI Discovery pointer (URI):	URL to fetch KEL/KSN/etc



 ðŸ§  Implementation Notes

You can compute the KSN SAID exactly as you do for other events:

```ts
const canonical = canonicalize(ksn);
const bytes = new TextEncoder().encode(canonical);
const hash = blake3(bytes, { dkLen: 32 });
ksn.d = encodeCESRDigest(hash, "E") as SAID;
```
