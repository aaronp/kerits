# **ðŸ§± KERI Delegation Specification Summary**

### **Purpose**

To allow one AID (the **Parent**) to authorize another AID (the **Delegate**) to act under its trust domain.  
 Delegation is cryptographically verifiable and revocable through the **KEL event chain** of both AIDs.

---

## **1\. Key Terms**

| Term | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Delegating AID (Parent)** | The controller granting authority. Anchors and validates delegate inception. |
| **Delegate AID (Child)** | The new AID whose inception event is authorized by the parent. |
| **Delegation event (`dlg`)** | Event in the childâ€™s KEL establishing it as a delegate. |
| **Anchoring interaction (`ixn`)** | Event in the parentâ€™s KEL that anchors the delegateâ€™s SAID, proving parent consent. |
| **Delegation acceptance** | A delegate KEL is valid only if the parentâ€™s KEL includes a corresponding anchor. |

---

## **2\. Basic Rule of Delegation**

A **delegated inception (`dlg`)** is **not valid** until the parent AID **anchors** that delegation in its own KEL.

That parent anchor is a signed event (e.g., an `ixn`) containing the delegateâ€™s SAID, providing verifiable authorization.

---

## **3\. Event Structures**

### **3.1 Delegateâ€™s KEL (Child)**

Inception event (`dlg`):

1. `{`  
2.   `"v": "KERI10JSON0001aa_",`  
3.   `"t": "dlg",`  
4.   `"d": "SAID(delegate-inception)",`  
5.   `"i": "E_delegate",`  
6.   `"s": "0",`  
7.   `"p": "",`  
8.   `"kt": "1",`  
9.   `"k": ["D..."],`  
10.   `"n": "SAID(next-key-set)",`  
11.   `"a": [{ "d": "SAID(parent)", "role": "delegator" }],`  
12.   `"dt": "2025-10-19T12:00:00Z"`  
13. `}`  
      
* **Signed by:** the delegateâ€™s key(s).

* **Referenced:** parentâ€™s AID in `a`.

  ### **3.2 Parentâ€™s KEL (Anchor)**

Parent anchors this delegate by including the delegateâ€™s SAID in an `ixn` event:

14. `{`  
15.   `"t": "ixn",`  
16.   `"d": "SAID(parent-ixn)",`  
17.   `"i": "E_parent",`  
18.   `"s": "5",`  
19.   `"p": "SAID(previous)",`  
20.   `"a": [{ "d": "SAID(delegate-inception)", "role": "delegate" }],`  
21.   `"dt": "2025-10-19T12:05:00Z"`  
22. `}`  
      
    ---

    ## **4\. Validation Rules**

A validator must confirm:

1. **Delegate event validity:**

   * Well-formed `dlg` event, valid SAID, proper signatures.

2. **Anchoring proof:**

   * Parentâ€™s KEL includes an `ixn` (or `rot`) anchoring the delegateâ€™s SAID.

3. **Temporal ordering:**

   * Parent anchor occurs **after** the delegateâ€™s `dlg`, but **before** any dependent delegate rotations or TEL updates.

4. **Parent authority continuity:**

   * Parent AIDâ€™s KEL remains valid (no revocation or rotation invalidating earlier keys).

5. **Revocation (optional):**

   * If parent later issues an event referencing the delegateâ€™s SAID with role `"revoked"`, the delegateâ€™s KEL becomes invalid past that point.

   # **ðŸ§ª Delegation Test Scenarios**

   ---

   ### **Scenario 1 â€“ Basic Delegated Inception**

**Goal:** Establish a child AID whose inception must be anchored by a parent.

**Steps:**

1. Create `AID_Parent` via normal `icp`.

2. Create `AID_Child` with a `dlg` event referencing `AID_Parent`.

3. Before anchoring, `AID_Child` is **not valid**.

4. Parent publishes `ixn` anchoring childâ€™s SAID.

5. Validation now succeeds.

âœ… *Child AID becomes valid after parent anchor.*

---

### **Scenario 2 â€“ Hierarchical Delegation (Org â†’ Dept â†’ Sub-Dept)**

**Goal:** Build a nested hierarchy of delegated AIDs.

**Steps:**

1. **Org AID** creates its KEL.

2. **Dept AID** creates `dlg` referencing **Org AID**.  
    Org anchors Deptâ€™s SAID.

3. **SubDept AID** creates `dlg` referencing **Dept AID**.  
    Dept anchors SubDeptâ€™s SAID.

4. Validation chain:

   * SubDept valid âŸ¹ Deptâ€™s anchor valid âŸ¹ Orgâ€™s anchor valid.

âœ… *Demonstrates multi-level delegation.*

---

### **Scenario 3 â€“ Delegated Device (Ad-hoc Sub-AID)**

**Goal:** User creates a secondary AID for a new device.

**Steps:**

1. Userâ€™s main AID (`AID_User`) exists.

2. New device creates `AID_Device` (`dlg` referencing `AID_User`).

3. `AID_User` performs `ixn` anchoring `AID_Device`â€™s SAID.

4. `AID_Device` may now perform its own TEL operations.

âœ… *Device acts as a trusted subordinate.*

---

### **Scenario 4 â€“ Delegation with Multi-Sig Parent**

**Goal:** Require group consensus to authorize a delegate.

**Steps:**

1. Parent AID is controlled by 2-of-3 controllers.

2. Delegateâ€™s `dlg` references Parent.

3. Parentâ€™s `ixn` anchor is only valid after â‰¥2 parent controllers sign it.

4. Observers accept delegate only after multi-sig anchor verified.

âœ… *Combines threshold signing and delegation.*

---

### **Scenario 5 â€“ Re-Delegation (Delegate â†’ Delegate)**

**Goal:** Allow a delegate to further delegate authority.

**Steps:**

1. AID\_Org delegates to AID\_Dept.

2. AID\_Dept delegates to AID\_Team.

3. Validation:

   * AID\_Team valid if AID\_Dept anchor exists *and* AID\_Org anchor exists.

4. Revoking AID\_Deptâ€™s delegation invalidates all downstream delegates.

âœ… *Models cascaded governance.*

---

### **Scenario 6 â€“ Revocation**

**Goal:** Parent revokes a previously delegated AID.

**Steps:**

1. Parent issues an `ixn` event anchoring delegateâ€™s SAID with role `"revoked"`.

2. Validators mark delegate AID as terminated.

3. Any further events from delegate beyond that point are rejected.

âœ… *Demonstrates revocation cascade.*

---

### **Scenario 7 â€“ Negative: Missing Parent Anchor**

**Goal:** Ensure unanchored delegate is rejected.

**Steps:**

1. Delegate issues `dlg`.

2. Parent **never** anchors it.

3. Observers replay:

   * See delegate KEL, but no corresponding parent anchor.

4. Reject delegate KEL as unauthorized.

âœ… *Confirms correct enforcement of delegation linkage.*

# **ðŸ§­ Validation Checklist**

| Step | Requirement |
| ----- | ----- |
| Verify `dlg` event structure & SAID | âœ… |
| Verify signatures meet delegateâ€™s `kt` | âœ… |
| Confirm parent anchor exists | âœ… |
| Confirm parent event SAID chain valid | âœ… |
| Enforce temporal order (`dlg` before parent anchor) | âœ… |
| Apply revocation rules (if any) | âœ… |

# **ðŸ“¦ Summary Table**

| Concept | Who Signs | Whatâ€™s Anchored | Valid When |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Delegate inception (`dlg`) | Delegateâ€™s keys | Parent AID reference | Parent anchors delegate SAID |
| Parent anchor (`ixn`) | Parentâ€™s keys | Delegateâ€™s SAID | Signifies authorization |
| Rotation (`rot`) | Delegateâ€™s keys | Prior event SAID | Valid only after parent anchor exists |
| Revocation | Parentâ€™s keys | Delegateâ€™s SAID | Terminates delegateâ€™s validity |

---

# **ðŸ§° Recommended TypeScript Structures**

23. `export interface Delegation {`  
24.   `parent: AID;`  
25.   `delegate: AID;`  
26.   `delegateSaid: SAID;`  
27.   `parentAnchor: SAID | null;`  
28.   `status: "pending" | "authorized" | "revoked";`  
29. `}`  
    

A simple resolver can determine the status by scanning both KELs for the presence (or absence) of the parent anchor.
