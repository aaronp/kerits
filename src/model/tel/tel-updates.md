# **ü™∂ TEL Update Specification**

*(Transaction Event Log ‚Äì Business / Data Layer)*

### **Purpose**

To record **transactional state transitions** controlled by a specific AID (as established in its KEL).  
 TEL events anchor domain-specific data (e.g. ACDCs, state changes, policies) to that AID‚Äôs key authority.

---

### **Event Types**

* `iss` ‚Äî **Issue** (initial issuance of a data record)

* `up` ‚Äî **Update** (new version or revision)

* `rev` ‚Äî **Revoke** (invalidate or withdraw prior state)

* *(optionally)* `anc` ‚Äî **Anchor** (explicit link to external record)

  ---

  ### **Append Preconditions**

To append a new event to a TEL:

1. **Resolve controller state**

   * Retrieve the controller AID‚Äôs latest KEL event.

   * Extract `k` (current signing keys) and `kt` (signing threshold).

   * **Ignore witnesses** (`w`, `wt`) ‚Äî not used in TEL validation.

2. **Build new TEL event**

   * Increment `s` (TEL sequence).

   * Set `p = SAID(previous TEL event)` (hash chain).

   * Set `dt` \= current timestamp.

   * Add anchors (`a`) to new or updated ACDCs, policy documents, etc.

3. **Signatures**

   * Event must have ‚â• `kt` valid signatures from the controller‚Äôs current keys (`k`).

4. **Optional endorsements**

   * If required by domain policy (e.g. ‚Äú2-of-3 validators‚Äù), include endorsement signatures and a reference to the policy ACDC that defines the rule.

   ---

   ### **Validation (for verifiers)**

1. Verify:

   * `p` links correctly to previous TEL event SAID.

   * Signatures from controller AID satisfy `kt`.

   * (Optional) Endorsements satisfy any referenced policy ACDC.

2. Ensure data integrity:

   * Anchored ACDCs or referenced records are retrievable and validly SAID-linked.

   * Sequence, timestamps, and state transitions are consistent.

   ---

   ### **Output**

* A valid **TEL event** in CESR format, signed by the AID controller.

* Optionally contains **endorsements** if required by business policy.

* The TEL‚Äôs state advances to reference the new authoritative data (ACDC, policy, etc.).
